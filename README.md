# FinalAccordGroupPack

## Prerequisites
To use this modpack, please download 
* [MultiMC](https://https://multimc.org/#Download)
* [This modpack](https://codeload.github.com/mech-a/FinalAccordGroupPack/zip/master)

## Installing
1. Extract MultiMC into a folder on your desktop using your favorite utility.
2. Open MultiMC.exe inside of the folder you extracted.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to install.
4. You should now be on the home screen; at the top there should be buttons labeled "Add Instance", "Folders", "Settings", etc.
5. Click Add Instance
6. Name it whatever you'd like and add a group if you'd like as well. 
7. Choose minecraft version **1.12.2**
8. Hit "OK"
9. Click and then right click on the instance in the main screen. You should see a dropdown menu. Choose edit instance from that.
10. You should see a screen with a left column stating things such as "Version", "Loader mods", "Resource packs", etc.
11. Make sure you are on the "Version" tab and click "Install Forge" on the right-hand side. Choose version **14.23.5.2768** and hit ok. It is the _not_ the current version with the star.
12. Click on the "Loader mods" tab and click "View Folder" in the bottom right.
13. You should now have an explorer screen opened with the mods folder. Open up the downloaded "FinalAccordGroupPack-master.zip" file.
14. Navigate into the folder until you find another zip labeled "GroupPack-021519.zip". Open this again and you should be presented with a list of .jar files.
15. Drag and drop these files into the explorer window that was opened in Step 12.

Congratulations! You have now installed the modpack. Launch and click "Connect to FinalAccord" to join.

## Settings
In the prior "edit instance" window, click on the "Settings" tab. You should see checkboxes near "Java installation", "Memory", and "Java arguments". Check on both Memory and Java arguments.
In memory, change the minimum and maximum to match around 2-3GB. You won't be able to boot the modpack with less than 2GB. Personally, I use 6GB.
In Java arguments, paste in this string:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-XX:SurvivorRatio=2 -XX:+DisableExplicitGC -d64 -XX:+UseConcMarkSweepGC -XX:+AggressiveOpts

In game, in settings, tweak things as necessary. I recommend playing on low chunks, 6 or so.
If you experience sharp lagspikes, continually add 1 gig of RAM until it stops. If it doesn't stop, Change the "BetterFPS Options" in the Settings menu of Minecraft to utilize a different algorithm.
